Game function is at the center of a difficult problem you have to deal
with in networking -- everybody has different INSTANCES of the
game. The server has its own, and both players have theirs too. This
can get confusing because the server will update a variable, and the
variable of the same name won't change in the clients (because they
have a different instance of it). To make sure everybody's on the same
page, the server regularly sends news about its variables to the
clients so that they can update their variables to reflect changes.

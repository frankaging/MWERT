  See expressjs documentation for more info on routing. The 'file' param will the string
  of characters after the port number in the URL. If you type:
  
  servername.blah.edu:8000/experiments/username/index.html

  Then 'file' will be bound to '/experiments/username/index.html' and
  you need to translate that into the location of that file on your
  server.
